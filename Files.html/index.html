            From humble beginnings, starting in a basement with a cracked version of Fruity Loops software recording friends and mixing vocals, Riot City Studio is a place where you can feel at home. Whether you're recording your next single, demo, or full album, Riot City Studio has what you need to take your project to the next level.

            Founded in 2012 by Adrian Saint and William Ross, Riot City Studio's main goal is to help local and regional, independent artists take their music from "Soundcloud good" to "radio ready". With that said, while our focus is on helping growing artists perfect their sound, we also have the equipment and knowledge at our disposal to record and produce major label artists. Basically stated; if you have a budget, we can accomodate.
